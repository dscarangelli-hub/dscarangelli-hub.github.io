<!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Who We Are</h2>

  <p>
    Western Solidarity With Ukraine Alliance (WSUA) was founded in <strong>2026</strong> in 
    <strong>Port Orchard, Washington</strong>. The organization emerged as a continuation of work with the 
    <strong>Solidarity With Ukraine Foundation in Kyiv</strong>, where our founder served as an international 
    liaison supporting humanitarian coordination and civil society initiatives.
  </p>

  <p>
    WSUA was created to bring that same spirit of solidarity to Washington State — connecting communities 
    across continents through humanitarian support, partnership, and informed advocacy. Our identity is rooted 
    in the belief that local action can have global impact, linking 
    <strong>Kitsap to Kupiansk, Port Orchard to Pokrovsk, Cascades to Carpathians</strong>.

<!-- MISSION SECTION -->
<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>

  <p>
    WSUA exists to strengthen humanitarian resilience, support trusted Ukrainian partners, and advance 
    legal research that contributes to long-term justice and recovery. We believe solidarity is not 
    limited by geography — it is a commitment to dignity, clarity, and meaningful action.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Humanitarian Assistance</strong> — providing generators, essential supplies, and community-level 
        support to help Ukrainians endure blackouts, displacement, and infrastructure attacks.</li>

    <li><strong>Support for Ukrainian Organizations</strong> — collaborating with trusted groups on the ground 
        to reinforce local resilience, expand community programs, and ensure aid reaches those who need it most.</li>

    <li><strong>Legal Research & Advocacy</strong> — drawing on our founder’s background in law, international 
        justice, and transitional justice, WSUA conducts research on reparations, restitution, and mass claims 
        mechanisms. This includes developing a comparative research paper and a clear, accessible guide to help 
        Ukrainians understand their rights and prepare for future claims processes.</li>
  </ul>

    Standing With Ukraine — In Action, Not Abstraction
  </div>

<!-- VISION SECTION -->
<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Our Vision</h2>

  <p>
    WSUA is built on the belief that informed, community-driven action can contribute to both immediate relief 
    and long-term justice. What begins in Port Orchard can meaningfully support families, advocates, and 
    communities thousands of miles away.
  </p>

  <p>
    We envision a future where solidarity is practical, principled, and accessible — where local communities 
    in Washington State can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukrainians working toward recovery, accountability, 
    and dignity.
