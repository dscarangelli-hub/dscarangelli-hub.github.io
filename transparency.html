      <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>

      <p>
        Western Solidarity With Ukraine Alliance (WSUA) was founded on the belief that humanitarian work must be accountable,
        verifiable, and open to public scrutiny. Transparency is not an optional virtue for us — it is a core operational value.
      </p>

      <ul class="values-list">
        <li><strong>Radical Openness:</strong> All financial reports, donor-source disclosures, and governance documents are made publicly accessible.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability to Donors:</strong> Every contribution is tracked, documented, and tied to a verifiable program outcome.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity in Reporting:</strong> We publish receipts, ledgers, and supporting documents without selective omission.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical Stewardship:</strong> Funds are used solely for mission-aligned humanitarian and advocacy purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Oversight:</strong> Anyone may review our documents, question our allocations, or request clarifications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>About U.S. 501(c)(3) Compliance</h3>
      <p>
        WSUA intends to pursue federal 501(c)(3) charitable status. While we are not yet recognized as a 501(c)(3), we voluntarily
        follow widely accepted nonprofit compliance norms, including:
      </p>

      <ul class="values-list">
        <li><strong>Clear Organizational Purpose:</strong> Activities must align with a charitable, educational, or humanitarian mission.</li>
        <li><strong>No Private Benefit:</strong> Funds cannot personally benefit board members, officers, or insiders.</li>
        <li><strong>Accurate Recordkeeping:</strong> Financial records, receipts, and donor information must be maintained and available for review.</li>
        <li><strong>Annual Reporting:</strong> 501(c)(3)s file Form 990-series returns; we prepare our records in anticipation of this requirement.</li>
        <li><strong>Governance Policies:</strong> Conflict-of-interest, whistleblower, and financial controls policies are standard expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Restrictions on Political Activity:</strong> 501(c)(3)s may not engage in partisan political activity and must limit lobbying.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="wsua-disclaimer">
