    <h2>What Is Humanitarian Aid?</h2>
    <p>
      Humanitarian aid is assistance given to people in crisis—whether from conflict, displacement,
      or disaster—to save lives, reduce suffering, and protect dignity. For Ukraine, this includes
      emergency relief, medical supplies, food, shelter, and support for displaced families and
      communities under threat.
    </p>
    <h3>How Humanitarian Aid Reaches Ukraine</h3>
    <p>
      Aid is delivered through a mix of international organizations, local NGOs, and grassroots
      networks. Vetted partners work on the ground to distribute supplies, run shelters, support
      hospitals, and help families access essential services. Coordination and transparency are
      critical so that help reaches those in need and is not misused.
