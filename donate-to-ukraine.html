    <h2>Choosing Where to Donate to Ukraine</h2>
    <p>
      Many organizations are doing vital work for Ukraine. When you give, it’s important to choose groups
      that are transparent, accountable, and aligned with your values. WSUA is one option—we focus on
      humanitarian aid, legal research, and the Energy Maidan Project for rural energy independence.

      <li><strong>Legal research</strong> — reparations, restitution, and claims guidance for Ukrainians.</li>
      <li><strong>Energy Maidan Project</strong> — generators, solar panels, and energy independence for rural communities.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — we publish our approach, documents, and commitment to accountability. <a href="/transparency.html">See our Transparency page</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other Vetted Options</h3>
    <p>
      We encourage you to research other reputable organizations working in and for Ukraine—UN agencies,
      established NGOs, and community-led initiatives. Give to groups that clearly state their mission,
      show how funds are used, and align with your goals.
